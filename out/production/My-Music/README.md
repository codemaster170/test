# My Music
 I need to design a Java Swing application for a Music Catalogue Interface that adheres to specific requirements using BorderLayout and GridLayout. The application must include specific components and functionality as described.  Key Requirements and Breakdown: Main Layout - BorderLayout  This layout divides the frame into five regions: North, South, West, Center, and East. You will use: North: A label with the title "My Music Catalogue" in bold font. South: A panel containing two buttons: "Submit" and "Exit." West: A list of categories (e.g., "Rap," "Reggae," and "Ballads") using either a JList or individual buttons. Center: A GridLayout panel that acts as a form for user input. Form Design - GridLayout for the Center Panel  The form should include: Text fields for: "Artist Name" "Recording Studio" Dropdown (JComboBox) for selecting a Category (categories should match those listed in the West region). Checkbox (JCheckBox) labeled "Available" to indicate if the item is available. Component Alignment and Functionality  Ensure that: The layout is visually clean and aligned. The Submit button captures the user’s input and prints the details to the console. The Exit button closes the application. Deadline  Start Date: 27/01/2025 Submission Deadline: 03/02/2025 Steps to Implement: Set Up the Project  Create a new Java Swing project in your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans). Import necessary Swing components: JFrame, JLabel, JPanel, JButton, JTextField, JComboBox, JCheckBox, JList, etc. Design the Layout  Create a JFrame and set its layout to BorderLayout. North: Add a JLabel with the text "My Music Catalogue". Use setFont() to make it bold. South: Add a JPanel with a FlowLayout or GridLayout containing the "Submit" and "Exit" buttons. West: Add a JList or individual buttons for categories like "Rap," "Reggae," and "Ballads." Center: Add a JPanel with a GridLayout (2 columns). Include form elements: JTextField for "Artist Name" and "Recording Studio." JComboBox for "Category." JCheckBox labeled "Available." Add Functionality  Submit Button: Add an ActionListener to capture and print the user’s input to the console. Exit Button: Add an ActionListener to close the application using System.exit(0). Testing  Run the program to ensure all components are aligned and functional. Test the console output on clicking "Submit." Test the application closure on clicking "Exit." Polish and Documentation  Ensure the UI is visually pleasing and user-friendly. Comment your code for clarity. Deliverables: A functional Java Swing application with: Proper layout and alignment. Fully functional "Submit" and "Exit" buttons. Source code with comments.
